Purpose:

Student Home is a web-based platform designed to help students find hostels easily while allowing hostel owners to advertise their properties. The project is still a work in progress and is not fully functional yet. I primarily focused on front-end development, implementing the user interface and basic interactivity. While the platform provides a structured layout and essential features, it is not fully responsive yet, and the back-end functionality needs further development.

Key Features & Functionalities:

âœ… Hostel Search & Comparison â€“ Students can browse available hostels and compare them based on facilities, pricing, and location. The platform provides a structured way to view multiple hostels side by side, helping students make informed decisions.

âœ… Detailed Hostel Listings â€“ Each hostel has a dedicated listing page displaying essential details such as room types, amenities (WiFi, food, laundry, security), rental prices, and location. This eliminates the need for students to physically visit every hostel before shortlisting options.

âœ… Hostel Owner Registration & Dashboard â€“ Hostel owners can sign up, log in, and list their hostels with descriptions, images, and pricing details. They can update their listings to ensure accurate information is available to students. (Currently, this functionality is in an early stage of implementation.)

âœ… Time & Effort Saving â€“ Instead of visiting multiple hostels in person, students can explore everything online from a single platform, saving time and effort in their hostel-hunting process.

âœ… Future Improvements (Planned Enhancements):

  Fully Responsive Design â€“ Making the platform fully functional on mobile devices.
   
  Advanced Search & Filtering â€“ Allowing users to refine their search with specific criteria (e.g., price range, facilities).
   
  User Authentication â€“ Secure login/signup for students and hostel owners.


Technologies Used:
